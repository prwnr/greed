# Greed - a stream monitor

Redis Streams monitor package written in Go.

It is meant to serve as a handy streams debugging tool, providing interactive terminal
interface to listen on all active streams and read their messages.

In addition to streams monitoring it provides automatic listening for [Laravel Streamer](https://github.com/prwnr/laravel-streamer) package.
